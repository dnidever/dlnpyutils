# David Nidever's Python Utility Functions

This package has a bunch of small functions that I find useful while working in python.
Currently they are all in single package and module called "dlnpyutils".

# Installation

Until I get this in pypi the best way is the usual git clone and setup install:

```
git clone https://github.com/dnidever/dlnpyutils.git
cd dlnpyutils
python setupy.py install
```

# Using the package

To import all of the package functions into the namespace do:
```python
from dlnpyutils.dlnpyutils import *
```

# Some of the functions

 - strjoin
